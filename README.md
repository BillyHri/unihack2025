# AllocateUs

A calendar to make groups to sync schedules with uni friends

People create their own profile and upload their calendar (.ics) from Allocate+. Users can join or create a group. Up to 10 people can join a group and their schedules can be synced. Within the rooms, users can view other people's calendars.

People can put their hobbies and interests on their profile, and AI can suggest activities for groups of people depending on their interests.
